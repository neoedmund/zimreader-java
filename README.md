ZIMReader in Java (neoe edition)
=================


A zimreader-java implementation can be found at 
https://github.com/wikimedia/openzim
and
https://github.com/openzim/openzim

This is another implementation, to be more java-lish.

The spec of ZIM file is some easy.

Currently, this library 
can find Title(Entry) by starting keyword.
cannot extract content(maybe soon).
cannot do full-text search.
cannot view html page.


my source is in  src/neoe/zim/

the test demo is  src/neoe/zim/NeoeZimTest.java
